## Identifying Required Capabilities

Once you've defined your outcomes and objectives, the next step is to identify which capabilities your organization needs to achieve those outcomes.

### Overview

This step bridges the gap between strategic goals (outcomes) and implementation (architecture and technology). By identifying required capabilities, you create a clear understanding of what your organization needs to be able to do.

### The Capability Identification Process

#### Step 1: Review Your Outcomes
Start with the outcomes and objectives defined in Step 1:
- What are you trying to achieve?
- What are your success criteria?
- What stakeholder needs must be met?

#### Step 2: Map Outcomes to Capabilities
For each outcome, ask:
- What do we need to be able to do to achieve this outcome?
- What business capabilities are required?
- Which capabilities are most critical?

Use the [MITA Capability Reference Model](capabilityModel.qmd) as a guide to:
- Find relevant capabilities
- Use consistent naming
- Understand capability definitions

#### Step 3: Identify Current Capabilities
Document what capabilities you already have:
- Which required capabilities currently exist?
- At what maturity level?
- Are they sufficient for your outcomes?

#### Step 4: Identify Capability Gaps
Compare required capabilities to current capabilities:
- Which required capabilities are missing?
- Which existing capabilities need enhancement?
- What's the gap in maturity levels?

#### Step 5: Prioritize Capabilities
Not all capabilities can be addressed at once. Prioritize based on:
- **Impact on Outcomes**: Which capabilities most directly support your outcomes?
- **Dependencies**: Which capabilities do other capabilities depend on?
- **Risk**: Which gaps present the highest risk?
- **Resources**: What can you realistically address?
- **Quick Wins**: Which provide early value?

#### Step 6: Validate with Stakeholders
Review identified capabilities with stakeholders:
- Do these capabilities address our needs?
- Are we missing anything?
- Are priorities appropriate?
- Is scope realistic?

### Example: Outcome to Capability Mapping

**Outcome**: Improve beneficiary experience through self-service options

**Required Capabilities**:
1. **Member Self-Service** (Primary)
   - Enables beneficiaries to access information online
   - Check eligibility status
   - View benefits information
   - Update personal information

2. **Member Portal** (Supporting)
   - Provides secure access to member information
   - Single sign-on capability
   - Mobile-responsive design

3. **Identity Management** (Foundational)
   - Authenticates user identity
   - Manages access controls
   - Protects privacy and security

4. **Communications Management** (Supporting)
   - Sends notifications and alerts
   - Provides multi-channel communication
   - Tracks communication history

5. **Document Management** (Supporting)
   - Stores and retrieves documents
   - Enables electronic document submission
   - Maintains document version control

### Using the Capability Reference Model

The MITA Capability Reference Model provides:

#### Standard Capability Definitions
- Consistent names and descriptions
- Clear scope for each capability
- Relationships between capabilities

#### Capability Hierarchy
- **Areas**: High-level groupings (e.g., Member Services, Provider Services)
- **Domains**: Logical groupings within areas (e.g., Eligibility, Enrollment)
- **Capabilities**: Specific abilities needed

#### Capability Attributes
- Description and scope
- Related business processes
- Information requirements
- Technology considerations
- Maturity progression

### Capability Selection Criteria

When identifying capabilities, ensure they are:

#### Outcome-Linked
Each capability should clearly support one or more outcomes. If you can't link a capability to an outcome, question whether it's needed.

#### Well-Defined
Use capabilities from the reference model or define new ones clearly. Avoid vague or overlapping capability definitions.

#### Appropriately Scoped
Capabilities should be:
- Not too broad (e.g., "Manage Everything")
- Not too narrow (e.g., "Print Report #42")
- Focused on business needs, not technology

#### Assessable
You should be able to assess the capability's maturity and performance. Include measurable aspects.

### Common Capability Patterns

#### Core Business Capabilities
Essential for Medicaid operations:
- Eligibility Determination
- Enrollment Management
- Claims Processing
- Provider Management
- Care Management

#### Supporting Capabilities
Enable core capabilities:
- Document Management
- Communications Management
- Reporting and Analytics
- Security and Privacy
- Identity Management

#### Foundational Capabilities
Underpin the entire enterprise:
- Data Management
- Integration Services
- Infrastructure Management
- Application Services
- Enterprise Architecture

### Dependency Management

Some capabilities depend on others:

#### Sequential Dependencies
- Capability B cannot function without Capability A
- Example: Claims Payment depends on Claims Adjudication

#### Shared Dependencies
- Multiple capabilities depend on a common capability
- Example: Multiple capabilities depend on Identity Management

#### Data Dependencies
- Capabilities that share common data entities
- Example: Eligibility and Claims both use Member data

Map dependencies to inform:
- Implementation sequencing
- Integration requirements
- Risk management

### Documentation

Document identified capabilities using:

#### Capability Inventory
List all required capabilities with:
- Capability name
- Description
- Linked outcomes
- Current maturity
- Target maturity
- Priority
- Dependencies

#### Capability Map
Visual representation showing:
- Capability hierarchy
- Relationships and dependencies
- Alignment to outcomes

#### Gap Analysis
For each capability:
- Current state assessment
- Target state definition
- Gap description
- Improvement approach

### Tools and Templates

Use MITA tools to support capability identification:

- **ORBIT Tool**: Map outcomes to capabilities, track gaps
- **Capability Assessment Worksheets**: Document current and target states
- **Capability Mapping Templates**: Visualize capability relationships

See [Tools and Resources](ORBIT.qmd) for details.

### Integration with Other Steps

Capability identification connects to:

- **Step 1 (Outcomes)**: Capabilities support outcomes
- **Step 3 (Architecture)**: Capabilities are implemented through architecture
- **Step 4 (Assessment)**: Capability maturity is assessed

This creates a complete line of sight from strategy to implementation.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

#### Starting with Technology
Don't start by listing systems. Start with what you need to be able to do (capabilities), then determine how to do it.

#### Too Many Capabilities
Focus on capabilities that truly matter for your outcomes. A prioritized list of 10-20 capabilities is more useful than 100.

#### Skipping Current State
Understanding what you already have is as important as identifying what you need.

#### Ignoring Dependencies
Failing to identify dependencies leads to implementation problems later.

#### Missing Stakeholder Input
Business stakeholders must be involved in identifying capabilities.

### Success Factors

Effective capability identification requires:

- Clear, well-defined outcomes (from Step 1)
- Stakeholder engagement throughout
- Use of the Capability Reference Model
- Honest current state assessment
- Realistic prioritization
- Clear documentation

### Next Steps

After identifying required capabilities:

1. Move to [Step 3: Define Architecture](DefineCapArch.qmd) to determine how to implement capabilities
2. Conduct [Step 4: State Self-Assessment](assessMaturity.qmd) to assess capability maturity
3. Use the [ORBIT Tool](ORBIT.qmd) to plan and track implementation
4. Review the complete [Capability Reference Model](capabilityModel.qmd) for detailed capability definitions
