    "text": "What is MITA\nThe Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA) Framework is an initiative by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in partnership with State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs) and Medicaid systems vendors. It aims to establish national guidance and best practice references for processes, data standards, and technologies that facilitate planning and enhance program administration for State Medicaid Enterprises. Building upon the foundation of previous versions, MITA 4.0 supports the Medicaid mission and goals by facilitating integrated business and information technology transformations. This version refines, refocuses, and repurposes MITA to better align with the evolving needs of SMAs.\nMITA 4.0 introduces several new approaches to enhance its relevance and accessibility, with the goal of making it more meaningful for stakeholders while streamlining processes to reduce the burden on state agencies. The framework incorporates various state agency viewpoints to improve efficiency and better align with the Advanced Planning Document process, certification outcomes, and state agency acquisition processes. Additionally, MITA 4.0 provides guidance that reflects current healthcare and IT trends, ensuring that it remains at the forefront of technological advancements.\nBy focusing on these enhancements, MITA 4.0 ensures that technology decisions align with Medicaid business needs, optimizing adaptability, flexibility, interoperability, and data sharing. This evolution enables significant improvements in policy, decision-making, and daily operations, ultimately advancing the capabilities of State Medicaid Enterprises.",

    "text": "MITA 4.0 Design Principles\nDuring the development of MITA 4.0, workgroup participants identified a set of core principles designed to prioritize updates MITA 3.0 that make MITA more meaningful and accessible to SMAs. These principles ensure that MITA remains a relevant and valuable tool for State Medicaid Agencies and their stakeholders.\nDefine Clear Linkages Between Capabilities and Outcomes: Establish clear definitions for both MITA Capabilities and Outcomes, and articulate the relationship between outcomes and the MITA architectures. This principle ensures that every capability is directly aligned with desired outcomes, linking strategic objectives with operational execution in a coherent framework.\nBusiness-Driven Transformation: Define business transformations with a focus on aligning IT solutions with both common and unique state needs. This principle ensures that technology initiatives are directly informed by business objectives, leading to more effective and tailored solutions.\nStandards First: Promote data and technical standards to improve IT development cost-effectiveness. By prioritizing standards, we aim to streamline processes and reduce complexity, ultimately enhancing interoperability and efficiency.\nReduce Burden on SMAs: Simplify processes and requirements to alleviate the administrative load on State Medicaid Agencies, enabling them to focus more on service delivery and less on compliance.\nEnable Automation: Encourage the adoption of automated processes to increase efficiency and accuracy in Medicaid operations, reducing manual intervention and the potential for errors.\nRelease Guidance Aligned with Current Trends: Provide guidance that reflects the latest trends in healthcare and IT, ensuring that MITA 4.0 remains relevant and forward-looking in its approach to Medicaid management.\nIntegrate with Other Activities: Enhance the integration of MITA with related activities such as APD development, Certification, T-MSIS reporting, and state procurement processes. This principle aims to create a cohesive framework that supports comprehensive Medicaid management and aligns with broader state and federal initiatives.\nTransition to a Web-Enabled Presentation: Move from the static, PDF-based MITA 3.0 to a dynamic, web-enabled format. This principle facilitates easier maintenance and continuous improvement by the community, allowing for real-time updates and enabling stakeholders to access the most current information. By fostering a collaborative environment, we encourage the sharing of insights and innovations, making MITA a more robust and adaptable framework for all users.\nThese principles are foundational to the development and implementation of MITA 4.0, ensuring it effectively supports the evolving needs of Medicaid operations.",

Using the reference model enables alignment of capabilities across SMA’s and enables states and CMS the ability to do the following: • Identify opportunities to collaborate, leverage and reuse. • Consistently assess and report capability maturity.\n\n\n\nMITA 4.0 Reference Model Application Example",

    "text": "The MITA Definition of Capability\nWithin the context of MITA, a capability can be defined as the ability or capacity of a State Medicaid Agency to achieve a desired outcome in compliance with the Standards and Conditions within 42 CFR 433.112. A capability may currently exist in an operational state or be envisioned for future development. Through careful planning, capabilities defined in this way can be matured and refined over time to become more effective and efficient. They can be organized and detailed at various levels of abstraction, providing precise descriptions for operational purposes or more generalized views for strategic planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Definition\n\n\n\n…a capability is defined as the ability or capacity of a SMA to achieve a desired outcome…\n\n\nTo fully define a business capability, it is essential to understand how it is realized through the integration of people, processes, information, and technology resources of an SMA. While these elements of the capability can change regularly, the capability itself is should endure over longer planning horizons, supporting the long-term alignment of business and IT and the achievement of increasingly beneficial business outcomes.\n\nStructure of the MITA Capability Model\nAs depicted in the model below, the MITA Capability Model orients the people, process, technology, and information resources to define a MITA Capability. This means that to model a capability the appropriate components of the information architecture and the technical architecture must be brought together with the business architecture to fully formulate any MITA Capability.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability Relationship Diagram\n\n\n\nBusiness Roles\nBusiness roles represent individual actors, stakeholders, or partners involved in delivering a business capability. A single organizational group or team may be wholly responsible for delivering the capability, or multiple business entities may share the delivery of a particular business capability. Business Roles perform Business Processes using Technology Resources. They require skills and knowledge resources to achieve outcomes, and should be actively engaged as partners in the development or enhancement of any capability they help deliver.\n\n\nBusiness Processes\nIndividual business capabilities may be enabled or delivered through a range of business processes that detail the activities (the how) associated with delivering the capability. Identifying and analyzing the efficiency of the underlying processes helps to optimize the business capability’s effectiveness. Identifying the processes within a business capability provides a focus for maturing the capability in concert with the other capability components. Business Processes operationalize Business Capabilities.\n\n\nInformation/Data\nInformation/data represents the business data, knowledge, and insight consumed or produced by the business capability (as distinct from IT-related data entities).

The sole criterion for an outcome to meet this definition is that it must be a goal of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) and be achieved through a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) capability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Definition\n\n\n\nA MITA outcome is a goal of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) that is achieved by a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) capability.\n\n\n\n\nMeasure\nMeasure is a quantifiable metric used to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of capabilities within a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES). Measures provide quantifiable and qualitative values that help State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs) track progress toward achieving specific outcomes, such as CMS-required or state-specific goals. These indicators might include metrics like processing times, error rates, or compliance levels.\nMeasures are a measurement threshold by establishing a specific value or level that must be met or exceeded to demonstrate successful performance. For instance, a KPI might set a threshold for the maximum allowable processing time for claims, ensuring that they are handled within a specified timeframe to maintain compliance and eligibility for enhanced federal funding. By monitoring these thresholds, organizations can ensure they are meeting regulatory requirements and delivering high-quality services to beneficiaries, while also identifying areas for improvement.\n\n\nMeasure Threshold\nA specific value or level of a measure that must be met or exceeded to demonstrate the effective achievement of a capability’s intended outcome. This threshold serves as a benchmark for assessing whether the processes, roles, and resources integrated within a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) are functioning optimally to meet the goals of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA). For example, a measurement threshold might be set for processing times, where claims must be processed within a certain number of days to ensure compliance with CMS-required outcomes and maintain eligibility for enhanced federal funding. By establishing and monitoring these thresholds, organizations can ensure they are meeting regulatory requirements and delivering high-quality services to beneficiaries.\n\n\nMeasurement\nThese outcomes and metrics are also used to ensure that healthcare systems or modules comply with applicable federal regulations, forming the baseline for system or module functionality. Achieving these outcomes is essential for continuing to receive enhanced federal funding for operations.

    "section": "Capability Mapping",
    "text": "Capability Mapping\nCapability mapping is a strategic tool that enables organizations, such as State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs), to systematically identify, organize, and visualize the key capabilities necessary to achieve their objectives. Within the MITA framework, capability mapping provides SMAs with a method of developing comprehensive views of the functions and processes required to deliver Medicaid services effectively. To begin the capability mapping process, SMAs should first identify the core capabilities that align with their strategic objectives, focusing on what the organization needs to achieve rather than how those goals are accomplished. This involves listing all necessary capabilities and understanding the desired outcomes they support. Next, these capabilities should be organized into domains and areas that reflect their strategic importance and interrelationships. Visualizing these capabilities through diagrams or maps provides all stakeholders a common view to understand the roles, processes, technology resources, and information/data involved in executing each capability, as well as the outcome each capability is designed to achieve. This structured approach not only highlights areas for improvement or investment but also ensures that organizational efforts are strategically aligned with desired outcomes.\nThe benefits of capability mapping are multifaceted, offering SMAs a clear pathway to strategic alignment and gap analysis. By visualizing capabilities, organizations can identify operational gaps and determine what new or enhanced capabilities are needed to close those gaps. This visualization also improves communication among stakeholders by providing a clear and concise representation of the organization’s functions. To refine capabilities, SMAs should analyze current operations, assess the efficiency of underlying processes, and optimize them to enhance capability effectiveness. Additionally, capability mapping serves as a foundation for heat mapping, which assesses the MITA Framework will utilize to visualize the maturity of each capability evaluated in the State Self-Assessment. SMAs can overlay heat maps over their capability maps to visualize many things other than maturity levels, using color coding to indicate areas of strength and weakness. Regular updates to these maps allow SMAs to monitor progress and ensure resources are allocated effectively to achieve strategic goals. The MITA framework includes examples of capability maps based on CMS-required outcomes, serving as a reference model for SMAs to develop their own capability maps tailored to state-specific goals and priorities. By leveraging the reference models provided by MITA, SMAs can ensure their capability mapping efforts are aligned with both federal requirements and state-specific priorities.\n\nOrganizing Capabilities\nTo enhance the resolution and detail of a capability and provide a unified view of all its components, a block diagram can be employed to provide a common view of any MES. This diagram effectively links the capability to business processes, roles, technical resources, and information resources through functional decomposition. By breaking down the capability into its constituent parts, the block diagram offers a visual representation that highlights the interrelationships and dependencies among these elements. This approach provides a clearer understanding of how each component contributes to the overall capability, facilitating more effective analysis, optimization, and alignment with organizational objectives.\n\nWe use this same method to present an this top level view of the capabilities required to achieve CMS-required outcomes. From this view increasingly detailed models can be constructed.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability Models\nThe MITA framework represents capabilities visually through a layered model that represent a capability of being composed of sub-capabilities and the processes, roles, information and technology resources (PRIT) that support the business in sustaining the capability. Each layer up depicts increasingly strategic capabilities and each layer down depicts the constituent elements that compose a capability in increasing operational detail. It is not the intention of this version of MITA to provide a full operational or tactical view of a capability, though SMAs may consider using this approach to improve their organizational awareness of their operations by developing further layers of their capabilities through functional decomposition.\n\n\nCapability Domains: The first layer of this model aims to group capabilities to organize the strategic view of an SMA’s capabilities. In this view one or many capabilities can be grouped within a domain to indicate the pursuit of common outcomes. Each domain is denoted with a single number to help annotate each capability.\nCapability Areas: The second layer of this model aims to provide a view of the groups of capabilities that compose a domain. They are organized to show capabilities that serve a specific group of similar outcomes and essential\nCapabilities: The third layer of this model provides a more detailed view view of\n\n\n\n\nRelationship of MITA Capabilities to Maturity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUnder development.\n\n\n\nLevels of Maturity\n\nDescription of the five levels of maturity in the MITA framework\nHow capabilities evolve and mature over time\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Capability Maps for Heat Mapping Strategic Priorities and Identifying Gaps with the MITA Maturity Model\nCapability maps are powerful tools that not only provide a visual representation of an SMA’s key capabilities but also serve as a foundation for strategic analysis and planning. There are many approaches to heat mapping capabilities, each offering unique insights into organizational priorities and gaps. Here, we describe two approaches: assessing maturity levels using the MITA Maturity Model and prioritizing strategic outcomes.\n\nIdentifying Gaps with the MITA Maturity Model\nThe MITA Maturity Model provides a framework for assessing the maturity of an organization’s capabilities across various dimensions, such as business processes, information, and technology. By integrating the maturity model with capability maps, SMAs can identify gaps between their current state and desired maturity levels.\n\nExample 1: Identifying Gaps in Data Management Maturity Using the PRIT Model\nAn SMA is conducting an assessment of its data management capabilities using the MITA Maturity Model, with a focus on the PRIT (Processes, Roles, Information, and Technology) framework. The capability map includes various data-related capabilities, such as “Data Integration,” “Data Quality Management,” and “Data Analytics.” Each of these capabilities is evaluated across the PRIT dimensions to determine their maturity levels using the revised scale:\nProcesses: Level 1: Ad-Hoc Roles: Level 2: Compliant Information: Level 2: Compliant Technology: Level 2: Compliant The capability map is updated to reflect the maturity assessment, with each dimension marked with a color code: red for Level 1: Ad-Hoc, yellow for Level 2: Compliant, green for Level 3: Efficient, blue for Level 4: Optimized, and purple for Level 5: Pioneering. This visualization helps the SMA prioritize strategic actions to enhance the “Data Integration” capability, such as standardizing processes, refining roles, improving data quality, and upgrading technology.\n\n\n\nHeat Mapping Strategic Priorities\nHeat mapping involves applying a color-coded overlay to a capability map to visually represent the status or priority level of each capability. This technique can be used to highlight areas of strength, weakness, or strategic importance. For example, capabilities that are critical to achieving CMS-required outcomes might be marked in one color, while those needing immediate attention or improvement could be marked in another. This visual representation helps stakeholders quickly grasp the strategic landscape and make informed decisions about where to allocate resources and focus efforts.\n\nExample 2: Prioritizing Capabilities for CMS-Required Outcomes\nAn SMA is focused on achieving specific CMS-required outcomes related to improving patient care and reducing administrative costs. The agency creates a capability map that outlines all the capabilities necessary to meet these outcomes. By applying a heat map, the SMA highlights capabilities that are directly linked to these outcomes in green, indicating they are of high strategic priority. Capabilities that are indirectly related or less critical are marked in yellow, while those that are currently underperforming or not aligned with strategic goals are marked in red.\nThis visual representation allows the SMA to quickly identify which capabilities require immediate attention and resources to ensure compliance with CMS requirements. For instance, if the capability related to “Claims Processing Efficiency” is marked in red, the agency can prioritize initiatives to enhance this capability, such as investing in new technology or streamlining processes.\n\n\n\nOther Uses for Capability Heat Mapping\nBeyond assessing maturity levels and prioritizing strategic initiatives, capability heat mapping can be applied in various other contexts to enhance organizational effectiveness and alignment.\n\nExample 3: Aligning Capabilities with State-Specific Initiatives\nAn SMA is working on a state-specific initiative to enhance telehealth services for rural populations. The capability map includes capabilities related to telehealth, such as “Telehealth Infrastructure,” “Provider Engagement,” and “Patient Access.” The SMA uses a heat map to highlight these capabilities in blue, indicating their alignment with the state-specific initiative.\nBy analyzing the capability map, the SMA identifies that “Provider Engagement” is a critical capability that requires further development to support the telehealth initiative. The agency decides to invest in training programs and outreach efforts to engage providers in rural areas, ensuring that the telehealth services are effectively delivered to the target population.\nThese examples demonstrate how capability maps, combined with heat mapping and the MITA Maturity Model, can provide valuable insights for strategic planning and gap analysis. By visualizing priorities and maturity levels, SMAs can make informed decisions about where to focus resources and efforts, ultimately enhancing their Medicaid Enterprise Systems and achieving strategic objectives.\n\nCapability Mapping\n\nIntroduction to capability mapping and its significance\nHow capabilities are organized and detailed at various levels of abstraction",

    "text": "Introduction to Business Capability Models\nA capability model is a conceptual framework that outlines the key capabilities an organization needs to achieve its strategic objectives. It provides a comprehensive view of what an organization can do and helps identify areas for improvement or investment. In the context of an orchestra, a capability model might help the orchestra identify the set of skills and resources, or other types of capabilities it needs to perform a symphony. Just like an orchestra needs well practiced musicians, sheet music, instruments, a conductor, and an audience to produce a great symphony, a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) needs its Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) to employ or develop specific capabilities to deliver its services effectively, efficiently, and economically to its enrollees and providers.\nThe concept of a business capability is extensively used within enterprise architecture modeling and has been broadly used within Business Capability Models as a tool to better align the business strategy and information technology of both private sector and governmental organizations since they emerged in the mid-2000s. One example comes from the TOGAF Standard, a well-known standard in enterprise architecture. Like most architecture frameworks TOGAF defines a capability as something a business can do to meet its goals. This focuses a strategic lens of an organization on “what” it needs to achieve its goals, rather than “how” those goals are achieved. This perspective allows for business planning from different viewpoints, facilitating strategic alignment and operational efficiency.\nSMA business architects, technologists, systems analysts, executives, managers, and program staff can use this same modeling approach to represent the functional components of their Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) in ways that can help reveal gaps in their systems and provide insights on what new or enhanced capabilities might be needed to close those gaps.\nBy focusing on capabilities, SMAs can better align their information and technology resources and processes with their strategic business goals, ultimately improving their insight into how to improve the outcomes their Medicaid Enterprise Architecture produces.",

This structured approach not only highlights areas for improvement or investment but also ensures that organizational efforts are strategically aligned with desired outcomes.\nThe benefits of capability mapping are multifaceted, offering SMAs a clear pathway to strategic alignment and gap analysis. By visualizing capabilities, organizations can identify operational gaps and determine what new or enhanced capabilities are needed to close those gaps. This visualization also improves communication among stakeholders by providing a clear and concise representation of the organization’s functions. To refine capabilities, SMAs should analyze current operations, assess the efficiency of underlying processes, and optimize them to enhance capability effectiveness. Additionally, capability mapping serves as a foundation for heat mapping, which assesses the MITA Framework will utilize to visualize the maturity of each capability evaluated in the State Self-Assessment. SMAs can overlay heat maps over their capability maps to visualize many things other than maturity levels, using color coding to indicate areas of strength and weakness. Regular updates to these maps allow SMAs to monitor progress and ensure resources are allocated effectively to achieve strategic goals. The MITA framework includes examples of capability maps based on CMS-required outcomes, serving as a reference model for SMAs to develop their own capability maps tailored to state-specific goals and priorities. By leveraging the reference models provided by MITA, SMAs can ensure their capability mapping efforts are aligned with both federal requirements and state-specific priorities.\n\nOrganizing Capabilities\nTo enhance the resolution and detail of a capability and provide a unified view of all its components, a block diagram can be employed to provide a common view of any MES. This diagram effectively links the capability to business processes, roles, technical resources, and information resources through functional decomposition. By breaking down the capability into its constituent parts, the block diagram offers a visual representation that highlights the interrelationships and dependencies among these elements. This approach provides a clearer understanding of how each component contributes to the overall capability, facilitating more effective analysis, optimization, and alignment with organizational objectives.\n\nWe use this same method to present an this top level view of the capabilities required to achieve CMS-required outcomes. From this view increasingly detailed models can be constructed.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability Models\nThe MITA framework represents capabilities visually through a layered model that represent a capability of being composed of sub-capabilities and the processes, roles, information and technology resources (PRIT) that support the business in sustaining the capability. Each layer up depicts increasingly strategic capabilities and each layer down depicts the constituent elements that compose a capability in increasing operational detail. It is not the intention of this version of MITA to provide a full operational or tactical view of a capability, though SMAs may consider using this approach to improve their organizational awareness of their operations by developing further layers of their capabilities through functional decomposition.\n\n\nCapability Domains: The first layer of this model aims to group capabilities to organize the strategic view of an SMA’s capabilities. In this view one or many capabilities can be grouped within a domain to indicate the pursuit of common outcomes. Each domain is denoted with a single number to help annotate each capability.\nCapability Areas: The second layer of this model aims to provide a view of the groups of capabilities that compose a domain. They are organized to show capabilities that serve a specific group of similar outcomes and essential\nCapabilities: The third layer of this model provides a more detailed view view of\n\n\n\n\nRelationship of MITA Capabilities to Maturity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUnder development.\n\n\n\nLevels of Maturity\n\nDescription of the five levels of maturity in the MITA framework\nHow capabilities evolve and mature over time\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Capability Maps for Heat Mapping Strategic Priorities and Identifying Gaps with the MITA Maturity Model\nCapability maps are powerful tools that not only provide a visual representation of an SMA’s key capabilities but also serve as a foundation for strategic analysis and planning. There are many approaches to heat mapping capabilities, each offering unique insights into organizational priorities and gaps. Here, we describe two approaches: assessing maturity levels using the MITA Maturity Model and prioritizing strategic outcomes.\n\nIdentifying Gaps with the MITA Maturity Model\nThe MITA Maturity Model provides a framework for assessing the maturity of an organization’s capabilities across various dimensions, such as business processes, information, and technology. By integrating the maturity model with capability maps, SMAs can identify gaps between their current state and desired maturity levels.\n\nExample 1: Identifying Gaps in Data Management Maturity Using the PRIT Model\nAn SMA is conducting an assessment of its data management capabilities using the MITA Maturity Model, with a focus on the PRIT (Processes, Roles, Information, and Technology) framework. The capability map includes various data-related capabilities, such as “Data Integration,” “Data Quality Management,” and “Data Analytics.” Each of these capabilities is evaluated across the PRIT dimensions to determine their maturity levels using the revised scale:\nProcesses: Level 1: Ad-Hoc Roles: Level 2: Compliant Information: Level 2: Compliant Technology: Level 2: Compliant The capability map is updated to reflect the maturity assessment, with each dimension marked with a color code: red for Level 1: Ad-Hoc, yellow for Level 2: Compliant, green for Level 3: Efficient, blue for Level 4: Optimized, and purple for Level 5: Pioneering. This visualization helps the SMA prioritize strategic actions to enhance the “Data Integration” capability, such as standardizing processes, refining roles, improving data quality, and upgrading technology.\n\n\n\nHeat Mapping Strategic Priorities\nHeat mapping involves applying a color-coded overlay to a capability map to visually represent the status or priority level of each capability. This technique can be used to highlight areas of strength, weakness, or strategic importance. For example, capabilities that are critical to achieving CMS-required outcomes might be marked in one color, while those needing immediate attention or improvement could be marked in another. This visual representation helps stakeholders quickly grasp the strategic landscape and make informed decisions about where to allocate resources and focus efforts.\n\nExample 2: Prioritizing Capabilities for CMS-Required Outcomes\nAn SMA is focused on achieving specific CMS-required outcomes related to improving patient care and reducing administrative costs. The agency creates a capability map that outlines all the capabilities necessary to meet these outcomes. By applying a heat map, the SMA highlights capabilities that are directly linked to these outcomes in green, indicating they are of high strategic priority. Capabilities that are indirectly related or less critical are marked in yellow, while those that are currently underperforming or not aligned with strategic goals are marked in red.\nThis visual representation allows the SMA to quickly identify which capabilities require immediate attention and resources to ensure compliance with CMS requirements. For instance, if the capability related to “Claims Processing Efficiency” is marked in red, the agency can prioritize initiatives to enhance this capability, such as investing in new technology or streamlining processes.\n\n\n\nOther Uses for Capability Heat Mapping\nBeyond assessing maturity levels and prioritizing strategic initiatives, capability heat mapping can be applied in various other contexts to enhance organizational effectiveness and alignment.\n\nExample 3: Aligning Capabilities with State-Specific Initiatives\nAn SMA is working on a state-specific initiative to enhance telehealth services for rural populations. The capability map includes capabilities related to telehealth, such as “Telehealth Infrastructure,” “Provider Engagement,” and “Patient Access.” The SMA uses a heat map to highlight these capabilities in blue, indicating their alignment with the state-specific initiative.\nBy analyzing the capability map, the SMA identifies that “Provider Engagement” is a critical capability that requires further development to support the telehealth initiative. The agency decides to invest in training programs and outreach efforts to engage providers in rural areas, ensuring that the telehealth services are effectively delivered to the target population.\nThese examples demonstrate how capability maps, combined with heat mapping and the MITA Maturity Model, can provide valuable insights for strategic planning and gap analysis. By visualizing priorities and maturity levels, SMAs can make informed decisions about where to focus resources and efforts, ultimately enhancing their Medicaid Enterprise Systems and achieving strategic objectives.\n\nCapability Mapping\n\nIntroduction to capability mapping and its significance\nHow capabilities are organized and detailed at various levels of abstraction",

The MITA Capability Model provides a structured way for SMAs to identify, conceptually model, and improve the capabilities needed for efficient Medicaid operations.\nIt is important to note that MITA 4.0 does not endeavor to specify all of the capabilities SMA’s may need to administer Medicaid programs; instead, this version of MITA focuses on the capabilities that are most closely oriented towards achieving the CMS-required outcomes. In this way MITA 4.0 provides a reference model for SMAs to model other capabilities that may be needed to achieve their other goals such as state specific outcomes, or other state priorities while providing more guidance within the MITA Framework to support modular.\n\n\nUpdate to MITA 3.0\nMITA 3.0 defined a capability as the level of maturity of a set of business processes within a business category. By focusing on “how” MES operate MITA 3.0 helped SMA’s identify ways to improve and mature their business processes, but it did not link those processes with the outcomes they are intended to achieve or ensure better alignment of the information and technical architectures to business outcomes. The addition of the MITA capability model to the MITA 4.0 business architecture addresses that by providing the conceptual linkages needed to elevate the strategic vantage point of the MITA Framework. To guide this change, we present within this chapter a definition, description, and approach to modeling business capabilities, based on the widely used capability models contextualized for Medicaid Enterprises.\nThe business processes that operationalize MITA capabilities remain foundational to characterizing the business architecture, and are by definition a constituent part of any MITA capability. They provide essential information on how capabilities are operationalize and should continue to be a routinely utilized reference model for SMA business process mapping.

    "section": "The MITA Definition of Capability",
    "text": "The MITA Definition of Capability\nWithin the context of MITA, a capability can be defined as the ability or capacity of a State Medicaid Agency to achieve a desired outcome in compliance with the Standards and Conditions within 42 CFR 433.112. A capability may currently exist in an operational state or be envisioned for future development. Through careful planning, capabilities defined in this way can be matured and refined over time to become more effective and efficient. They can be organized and detailed at various levels of abstraction, providing precise descriptions for operational purposes or more generalized views for strategic planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Definition\n\n\n\n…a capability is defined as the ability or capacity of a SMA to achieve a desired outcome…\n\n\nTo fully define a business capability, it is essential to understand how it is realized through the integration of people, processes, information, and technology resources of an SMA. While these elements of the capability can change regularly, the capability itself is should endure over longer planning horizons, supporting the long-term alignment of business and IT and the achievement of increasingly beneficial business outcomes.\n\nStructure of the MITA Capability Model\nAs depicted in the model below, the MITA Capability Model orients the people, process, technology, and information resources to define a MITA Capability. This means that to model a capability the appropriate components of the information architecture and the technical architecture must be brought together with the business architecture to fully formulate any MITA Capability.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability Relationship Diagram\n\n\n\nBusiness Roles\nBusiness roles represent individual actors, stakeholders, or partners involved in delivering a business capability. A single organizational group or team may be wholly responsible for delivering the capability, or multiple business entities may share the delivery of a particular business capability. Business Roles perform Business Processes using Technology Resources. They require skills and knowledge resources to achieve outcomes, and should be actively engaged as partners in the development or enhancement of any capability they help deliver.\n\n\nBusiness Processes\nIndividual business capabilities may be enabled or delivered through a range of business processes that detail the activities (the how) associated with delivering the capability. Identifying and analyzing the efficiency of the underlying processes helps to optimize the business capability’s effectiveness. Identifying the processes within a business capability provides a focus for maturing the capability in concert with the other capability components. Business Processes operationalize Business Capabilities.\n\n\nInformation/Data\nInformation/data represents the business data, knowledge, and insight consumed or produced by the business capability (as distinct from IT-related data entities). This may also include information that the capability exchanges with other capabilities to support the execution of value streams. Examples include information about customers and prospects, products and services, business policies and rules, sales reports, and performance metrics. Information/data inform the Business Capability, answering questions and supporting business rules.\n\n\nTechnology Resources\nBusiness capabilities rely on a range of tools, applications, systems, and services for successful execution. Technology Resources use Information/data to facilitate Business Processes. Such resources may include:\n\nModular software applications\nCloud or on-premise infrastructure\nMicroservices\nAnalytics\nCustomer portal\n\nIn this way we can clearly interrelate all of the MITA architecture models and their individual components which allows us to reveal gaps not only in the individual components of the architecture, but also understand their impact on the integration of the architecture components at the capability level.\n\n\n\nRelationship of MITA Capabilities to Outcomes\nIn the context of the Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA), outcomes are intrinsically linked to capabilities, as they represent the tangible results achieved through the effective integration and execution of various elements that constitute a capability. In this sense, outcomes and capabilities define each other.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability and Outcome Relationship Diagram\n\n\n\nOutcomes\nMITA defines outcomes broadly to encompass CMS-required outcomes, state-specific outcomes, and other outcomes not mandated as part of the Advance Planning Document (APD) process. The sole criterion for an outcome to meet this definition is that it must be a goal of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) and be achieved through a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) capability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Definition\n\n\n\nA MITA outcome is a goal of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) that is achieved by a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) capability.\n\n\n\n\nMeasure\nMeasure is a quantifiable metric used to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of capabilities within a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES). Measures provide quantifiable and qualitative values that help State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs) track progress toward achieving specific outcomes, such as CMS-required or state-specific goals. These indicators might include metrics like processing times, error rates, or compliance levels.\nMeasures are a measurement threshold by establishing a specific value or level that must be met or exceeded to demonstrate successful performance. For instance, a KPI might set a threshold for the maximum allowable processing time for claims, ensuring that they are handled within a specified timeframe to maintain compliance and eligibility for enhanced federal funding. By monitoring these thresholds, organizations can ensure they are meeting regulatory requirements and delivering high-quality services to beneficiaries, while also identifying areas for improvement.\n\n\nMeasure Threshold\nA specific value or level of a measure that must be met or exceeded to demonstrate the effective achievement of a capability’s intended outcome. This threshold serves as a benchmark for assessing whether the processes, roles, and resources integrated within a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) are functioning optimally to meet the goals of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA). For example, a measurement threshold might be set for processing times, where claims must be processed within a certain number of days to ensure compliance with CMS-required outcomes and maintain eligibility for enhanced federal funding. By establishing and monitoring these thresholds, organizations can ensure they are meeting regulatory requirements and delivering high-quality services to beneficiaries.\n\n\nMeasurement\nThese outcomes and metrics are also used to ensure that healthcare systems or modules comply with applicable federal regulations, forming the baseline for system or module functionality. Achieving these outcomes is essential for continuing to receive enhanced federal funding for operations. Regular measurement and analysis of KPIs help organizations demonstrate compliance and effectiveness, ensuring that they meet regulatory requirements and continue to deliver high-quality services to beneficiaries.\nIn this way we can clearly interrelate all of the MITA architecture models and their individual components with the KPIs, thresholds, and measurements that indicate whether our capability achieves our desired outcome.\nWhile models that help conceptualize the capabilities that achieve CMS-required outcomes are the ones modeled for this version of MITA, SMAs are encouraged to use these models as a reference to model capabilities.",

The MITA Capability Model provides a structured way for SMAs to identify, conceptually model, and improve the capabilities needed for efficient Medicaid operations.\nIt is important to note that MITA 4.0 does not endeavor to specify all of the capabilities SMA’s may need to administer Medicaid programs; instead, this version of MITA focuses on the capabilities that are most closely oriented towards achieving the CMS-required outcomes. In this way MITA 4.0 provides a reference model for SMAs to model other capabilities that may be needed to achieve their other goals such as state specific outcomes, or other state priorities while providing more guidance within the MITA Framework to support modular.\n\n\nUpdate to MITA 3.0\nMITA 3.0 defined a capability as the level of maturity of a set of business processes within a business category. By focusing on “how” MES operate MITA 3.0 helped SMA’s identify ways to improve and mature their business processes, but it did not link those processes with the outcomes they are intended to achieve or ensure better alignment of the information and technical architectures to business outcomes. The addition of the MITA capability model to the MITA 4.0 business architecture addresses that by providing the conceptual linkages needed to elevate the strategic vantage point of the MITA Framework. To guide this change, we present within this chapter a definition, description, and approach to modeling business capabilities, based on the widely used capability models contextualized for Medicaid Enterprises.\nThe business processes that operationalize MITA capabilities remain foundational to characterizing the business architecture, and are by definition a constituent part of any MITA capability. They provide essential information on how capabilities are operationalize and should continue to be a routinely utilized reference model for SMA business process mapping. They are found with in the Business Process Model chapter of this version of MITA.",

    "section": "The MITA Definition of Capability",
    "text": "The MITA Definition of Capability\nWithin the context of MITA, a capability can be defined as the ability or capacity of a State Medicaid Agency to achieve a desired outcome in compliance with the Standards and Conditions within 42 CFR 433.112. A capability may currently exist in an operational state or be envisioned for future development. Through careful planning, capabilities defined in this way can be matured and refined over time to become more effective and efficient. They can be organized and detailed at various levels of abstraction, providing precise descriptions for operational purposes or more generalized views for strategic planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Definition\n\n\n\n…a capability is defined as the ability or capacity of a SMA to achieve a desired outcome…\n\n\nTo fully define a business capability, it is essential to understand how it is realized through the integration of people, processes, information, and technology resources of an SMA. While these elements of the capability can change regularly, the capability itself is should endure over longer planning horizons, supporting the long-term alignment of business and IT and the achievement of increasingly beneficial business outcomes.\n\nStructure of the MITA Capability Model\nAs depicted in the model below, the MITA Capability Model orients the people, process, technology, and information resources to define a MITA Capability. This means that to model a capability the appropriate components of the information architecture and the technical architecture must be brought together with the business architecture to fully formulate any MITA Capability.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability Relationship Diagram\n\n\n\nBusiness Roles\nBusiness roles represent individual actors, stakeholders, or partners involved in delivering a business capability. A single organizational group or team may be wholly responsible for delivering the capability, or multiple business entities may share the delivery of a particular business capability. Business Roles perform Business Processes using Technology Resources. They require skills and knowledge resources to achieve outcomes, and should be actively engaged as partners in the development or enhancement of any capability they help deliver.\n\n\nBusiness Processes\nIndividual business capabilities may be enabled or delivered through a range of business processes that detail the activities (the how) associated with delivering the capability. Identifying and analyzing the efficiency of the underlying processes helps to optimize the business capability’s effectiveness. Identifying the processes within a business capability provides a focus for maturing the capability in concert with the other capability components. Business Processes operationalize Business Capabilities.\n\n\nInformation/Data\nInformation/data represents the business data, knowledge, and insight consumed or produced by the business capability (as distinct from IT-related data entities). This may also include information that the capability exchanges with other capabilities to support the execution of value streams. Examples include information about customers and prospects, products and services, business policies and rules, sales reports, and performance metrics. Information/data inform the Business Capability, answering questions and supporting business rules.\n\n\nTechnology Resources\nBusiness capabilities rely on a range of tools, applications, systems, and services for successful execution. Technology Resources use Information/data to facilitate Business Processes. Such resources may include:\n\nModular software applications\nCloud or on-premise infrastructure\nMicroservices\nAnalytics\nCustomer portal\n\nIn this way we can clearly interrelate all of the MITA architecture models and their individual components which allows us to reveal gaps not only in the individual components of the architecture, but also understand their impact on the integration of the architecture components at the capability level.\n\n\n\nRelationship of MITA Capabilities to Outcomes\nIn the context of the Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA), outcomes are intrinsically linked to capabilities, as they represent the tangible results achieved through the effective integration and execution of various elements that constitute a capability. In this sense, outcomes and capabilities define each other.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability and Outcome Relationship Diagram\n\n\n\nOutcomes\nMITA defines outcomes broadly to encompass CMS-required outcomes, state-specific outcomes, and other outcomes not mandated as part of the Advance Planning Document (APD) process. The sole criterion for an outcome to meet this definition is that it must be a goal of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) and be achieved through a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) capability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Definition\n\n\n\nA MITA outcome is a goal of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) that is achieved by a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) capability.\n\n\n\n\nMeasure\nMeasure is a quantifiable metric used to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of capabilities within a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES). Measures provide quantifiable and qualitative values that help State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs) track progress toward achieving specific outcomes, such as CMS-required or state-specific goals. These indicators might include metrics like processing times, error rates, or compliance levels.\nMeasures are a measurement threshold by establishing a specific value or level that must be met or exceeded to demonstrate successful performance. For instance, a KPI might set a threshold for the maximum allowable processing time for claims, ensuring that they are handled within a specified timeframe to maintain compliance and eligibility for enhanced federal funding. By monitoring these thresholds, organizations can ensure they are meeting regulatory requirements and delivering high-quality services to beneficiaries, while also identifying areas for improvement.\n\n\nMeasure Threshold\nA specific value or level of a measure that must be met or exceeded to demonstrate the effective achievement of a capability’s intended outcome. This threshold serves as a benchmark for assessing whether the processes, roles, and resources integrated within a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) are functioning optimally to meet the goals of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA). For example, a measurement threshold might be set for processing times, where claims must be processed within a certain number of days to ensure compliance with CMS-required outcomes and maintain eligibility for enhanced federal funding. By establishing and monitoring these thresholds, organizations can ensure they are meeting regulatory requirements and delivering high-quality services to beneficiaries.\n\n\nMeasurement\nThese outcomes and metrics are also used to ensure that healthcare systems or modules comply with applicable federal regulations, forming the baseline for system or module functionality. Achieving these outcomes is essential for continuing to receive enhanced federal funding for operations. Regular measurement and analysis of KPIs help organizations demonstrate compliance and effectiveness, ensuring that they meet regulatory requirements and continue to deliver high-quality services to beneficiaries.\nIn this way we can clearly interrelate all of the MITA architecture models and their individual components with the KPIs, thresholds, and measurements that indicate whether our capability achieves our desired outcome.\nWhile models that help conceptualize the capabilities that achieve CMS-required outcomes are the ones modeled for this version of MITA, SMAs are encouraged to use these models as a reference to model capabilities.",

    "section": "Capability Mapping",
    "text": "Capability Mapping\nCapability mapping is a strategic tool that enables organizations, such as State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs), to systematically identify, organize, and visualize the key capabilities necessary to achieve their objectives. Within the MITA framework, capability mapping provides SMAs with a method of developing comprehensive views of the functions and processes required to deliver Medicaid services effectively. To begin the capability mapping process, SMAs should first identify the core capabilities that align with their strategic objectives, focusing on what the organization needs to achieve rather than how those goals are accomplished. This involves listing all necessary capabilities and understanding the desired outcomes they support. Next, these capabilities should be organized into domains and areas that reflect their strategic importance and interrelationships. Visualizing these capabilities through diagrams or maps provides all stakeholders a common view to understand the roles, processes, technology resources, and information/data involved in executing each capability, as well as the outcome each capability is designed to achieve. This structured approach not only highlights areas for improvement or investment but also ensures that organizational efforts are strategically aligned with desired outcomes.\nThe benefits of capability mapping are multifaceted, offering SMAs a clear pathway to strategic alignment and gap analysis. By visualizing capabilities, organizations can identify operational gaps and determine what new or enhanced capabilities are needed to close those gaps. This visualization also improves communication among stakeholders by providing a clear and concise representation of the organization’s functions. To refine capabilities, SMAs should analyze current operations, assess the efficiency of underlying processes, and optimize them to enhance capability effectiveness. Additionally, capability mapping serves as a foundation for heat mapping, which assesses the MITA Framework will utilize to visualize the maturity of each capability evaluated in the State Self-Assessment. SMAs can overlay heat maps over their capability maps to visualize many things other than maturity levels, using color coding to indicate areas of strength and weakness. Regular updates to these maps allow SMAs to monitor progress and ensure resources are allocated effectively to achieve strategic goals. The MITA framework includes examples of capability maps based on CMS-required outcomes, serving as a reference model for SMAs to develop their own capability maps tailored to state-specific goals and priorities. By leveraging the reference models provided by MITA, SMAs can ensure their capability mapping efforts are aligned with both federal requirements and state-specific priorities.\n\nOrganizing Capabilities\nTo enhance the resolution and detail of a capability and provide a unified view of all its components, a block diagram can be employed to provide a common view of any MES. This diagram effectively links the capability to business processes, roles, technical resources, and information resources through functional decomposition. By breaking down the capability into its constituent parts, the block diagram offers a visual representation that highlights the interrelationships and dependencies among these elements. This approach provides a clearer understanding of how each component contributes to the overall capability, facilitating more effective analysis, optimization, and alignment with organizational objectives.\n\nWe use this same method to present an this top level view of the capabilities required to achieve CMS-required outcomes. From this view increasingly detailed models can be constructed.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability Models\nThe MITA framework represents capabilities visually through a layered model that represent a capability of being composed of sub-capabilities and the processes, roles, information and technology resources (PRIT) that support the business in sustaining the capability. Each layer up depicts increasingly strategic capabilities and each layer down depicts the constituent elements that compose a capability in increasing operational detail. It is not the intention of this version of MITA to provide a full operational or tactical view of a capability, though SMAs may consider using this approach to improve their organizational awareness of their operations by developing further layers of their capabilities through functional decomposition.\n\n\nCapability Domains: The first layer of this model aims to group capabilities to organize the strategic view of an SMA’s capabilities. In this view one or many capabilities can be grouped within a domain to indicate the pursuit of common outcomes. Each domain is denoted with a single number to help annotate each capability.\nCapability Areas: The second layer of this model aims to provide a view of the groups of capabilities that compose a domain. They are organized to show capabilities that serve a specific group of similar outcomes and essential\nCapabilities: The third layer of this model provides a more detailed view view of\n\n\n\n\nRelationship of MITA Capabilities to Maturity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUnder development.\n\n\n\nLevels of Maturity\n\nDescription of the five levels of maturity in the MITA framework\nHow capabilities evolve and mature over time\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Capability Maps for Heat Mapping Strategic Priorities and Identifying Gaps with the MITA Maturity Model\nCapability maps are powerful tools that not only provide a visual representation of an SMA’s key capabilities but also serve as a foundation for strategic analysis and planning. There are many approaches to heat mapping capabilities, each offering unique insights into organizational priorities and gaps. Here, we describe two approaches: assessing maturity levels using the MITA Maturity Model and prioritizing strategic outcomes.\n\nIdentifying Gaps with the MITA Maturity Model\nThe MITA Maturity Model provides a framework for assessing the maturity of an organization’s capabilities across various dimensions, such as business processes, information, and technology. By integrating the maturity model with capability maps, SMAs can identify gaps between their current state and desired maturity levels.\n\nExample 1: Identifying Gaps in Data Management Maturity Using the PRIT Model\nAn SMA is conducting an assessment of its data management capabilities using the MITA Maturity Model, with a focus on the PRIT (Processes, Roles, Information, and Technology) framework. The capability map includes various data-related capabilities, such as “Data Integration,” “Data Quality Management,” and “Data Analytics.” Each of these capabilities is evaluated across the PRIT dimensions to determine their maturity levels using the revised scale:\nProcesses: Level 1: Ad-Hoc Roles: Level 2: Compliant Information: Level 2: Compliant Technology: Level 2: Compliant The capability map is updated to reflect the maturity assessment, with each dimension marked with a color code: red for Level 1: Ad-Hoc, yellow for Level 2: Compliant, green for Level 3: Efficient, blue for Level 4: Optimized, and purple for Level 5: Pioneering. This visualization helps the SMA prioritize strategic actions to enhance the “Data Integration” capability, such as standardizing processes, refining roles, improving data quality, and upgrading technology.\n\n\n\nHeat Mapping Strategic Priorities\nHeat mapping involves applying a color-coded overlay to a capability map to visually represent the status or priority level of each capability. This technique can be used to highlight areas of strength, weakness, or strategic importance. For example, capabilities that are critical to achieving CMS-required outcomes might be marked in one color, while those needing immediate attention or improvement could be marked in another. This visual representation helps stakeholders quickly grasp the strategic landscape and make informed decisions about where to allocate resources and focus efforts.\n\nExample 2: Prioritizing Capabilities for CMS-Required Outcomes\nAn SMA is focused on achieving specific CMS-required outcomes related to improving patient care and reducing administrative costs. The agency creates a capability map that outlines all the capabilities necessary to meet these outcomes. By applying a heat map, the SMA highlights capabilities that are directly linked to these outcomes in green, indicating they are of high strategic priority. Capabilities that are indirectly related or less critical are marked in yellow, while those that are currently underperforming or not aligned with strategic goals are marked in red.\nThis visual representation allows the SMA to quickly identify which capabilities require immediate attention and resources to ensure compliance with CMS requirements. For instance, if the capability related to “Claims Processing Efficiency” is marked in red, the agency can prioritize initiatives to enhance this capability, such as investing in new technology or streamlining processes.\n\n\n\nOther Uses for Capability Heat Mapping\nBeyond assessing maturity levels and prioritizing strategic initiatives, capability heat mapping can be applied in various other contexts to enhance organizational effectiveness and alignment.\n\nExample 3: Aligning Capabilities with State-Specific Initiatives\nAn SMA is working on a state-specific initiative to enhance telehealth services for rural populations. The capability map includes capabilities related to telehealth, such as “Telehealth Infrastructure,” “Provider Engagement,” and “Patient Access.” The SMA uses a heat map to highlight these capabilities in blue, indicating their alignment with the state-specific initiative.\nBy analyzing the capability map, the SMA identifies that “Provider Engagement” is a critical capability that requires further development to support the telehealth initiative. The agency decides to invest in training programs and outreach efforts to engage providers in rural areas, ensuring that the telehealth services are effectively delivered to the target population.\nThese examples demonstrate how capability maps, combined with heat mapping and the MITA Maturity Model, can provide valuable insights for strategic planning and gap analysis. By visualizing priorities and maturity levels, SMAs can make informed decisions about where to focus resources and efforts, ultimately enhancing their Medicaid Enterprise Systems and achieving strategic objectives.\n\nCapability Mapping\n\nIntroduction to capability mapping and its significance\nHow capabilities are organized and detailed at various levels of abstraction",

    "text": "Purpose\nIn keeping with the guiding principle that MITA represents a business-driven enterprise transformation, the BA is the starting point of the MITA Framework. The BA describes the needs and goals of the individual State Medicaid Enterprise, and presents a collective vision of the future.\nThe BA will accomplish the following:\n\nEstablish a generic business framework for all States while recognizing their differences.\nDescribe how each state Medicaid Program can mature over a given period with the help of stakeholders, leadership, enabling legislation, and technology.\nProvide a baseline for the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) to assess their current business capabilities and measure progress toward improved capabilities.\n\n\n\nScope\nThe BA focuses on the State Medicaid Enterprise that centers on the Medicaid environment including leveraged systems and interconnections among Medicaid stakeholders, providers, beneficiaries, insurance affordability programs (e.g., CHIP, tax credits, Basic Health Program), Health Insurance Exchange (HIX), Health Information Exchange (HIE), other state and local agencies, other payers, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and other federal agencies. The MITA context defines the Medicaid Enterprise as:\n\nThe domain where federal matching funds apply.\nThe interfaces and bridges among Medicaid stakeholders, including providers, beneficiaries, other state and local agencies, other payers, CMS, and other federal agencies.\nThe sphere of influence touched by MITA (e.g., national and federal initiatives such as the Nationwide Health Information Network [NwHIN]). (See Front Matter, Chapter 6, Overview of the MITA Initiative, for a discussion of the Medicaid Enterprise.)\n\nEnterprise can have other meanings. For instance, Enterprise Architecture (EA) defines an enterprise-wide integrated set of components that incorporates strategic business thinking, information assets, and the technical infrastructure of an enterprise to promote information sharing across agency and organizational boundaries.\nThe BA acknowledges technology as one of several enablers that are important to growth and transformation, but it does not introduce technical implementations or solutions into the BA components. All technical references are found in Part III, Technical Architecture.\n\n\nBackground\nStates, territories, and the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as States) are responsible for their individual State Medicaid Enterprise, and all entities are different in important ways. Differences include:\n\nOrganizational structure, covered programs, and lines of business\nBusiness rules, policies, and procedures affecting stakeholders\nRelationships with other state and local agencies\nRevenue sources\nLocation of business units\nWorkflow\nRange of outsourcing\nTechnical solutions\n\n\nThese entities also differ in their concept of an enterprise, the roles and responsibilities of one or more Chief Information Officers (CIO), adoption of data and technical standards, and the use of legacy versus state-of-the-art applications.\nGiven these differences, it is not possible or desirable, in the context of the MITA Framework, to develop a standalone business and technical model for each individual Medicaid Enterprise. Instead, MITA establishes a national framework of common processes and enabling technologies to support improved program administration in all States.\nThe BA focuses on areas of common ground (e.g., that all States will enroll providers and pay for services rendered to eligible beneficiaries and that all States seek to improve health care outcomes and improve administrative processes).\nThere is no ready-made methodology for building the MITA Framework to accommodate the business needs and transformation strategies of the States. To meet the special needs of MITA, the components included in the BA draw upon methodologies commonly in use today across industries as diverse as financial, transportation, and defense. The MITA team designed templates and models to help States identify and prioritize their specific business needs.\nThe BA section of the MITA Framework shows how MITA incorporates business-driven design to accomplish the following:\n\nSupport state needs.\n\no Align with state strategic goals.\no Align with state or Medicaid Agency enterprise architecture.\n\nSupport the CMS and common state goals.\n\no Align state approaches with MITA.\no Accommodate multi-state collaborative initiatives.\n\nSupport national goals through alignment with national initiatives, such as the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and federal guidelines (e.g., Federal Health Architecture (FHA), the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF), and national/international data standards).",

The MMM adapts the industry model to the Medicaid Enterprise by describing Medicaid Program goals and objectives and the maturation of the MITA technical principles. The\ntransformation through each of the five (5) levels represents significant business capabilities advances over the previous period.\nThe MMM describes the five (5) levels of maturity and the measurable qualities that each level demonstrates. The general description is at a high enough level to apply to most aspects of State Medicaid Enterprise operations. For example, the MMM defines, at Level 1, the business area or process is in compliance with current regulations. At Level 2, the process matures because of pressures for cost containment and availability of newer tools. At Level 3, noticeable improvement occurs in the standardization and sharing of information\n\nand processes among multiple entities, including the beneficiary. At Level 4, instant availability of clinical information increases the transformation. By Level 5, States and local agencies have become interoperable across the United States.\nThe MMM is the point of reference for the BCM. The BCM aligns with the MMM to maintain consistency of definition. Part I, Chapter 3, Maturity Model, presents details of the MMM, and Part I, Appendix B, Maturity Model Details, contains the complete detailed text.\n\nBusiness Process Model\n\nThe BPM is a collection of common business processes for the operation of Medicaid Programs. A template describes those processes, including current and near-term operations as defined in Level 3 of the BCM. The MITA Framework BPM\nderives from multiple sources that create a common model that reflects most State Medicaid Enterprises – notable sources include the S-TAG Redesign of the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), and the CMS MHCCM, that consolidates business processes from a dozen States.\nStates should develop business workflows for the different business functions of the state to advance the alignment of the state’s capability maturity with the MMM. These business workflows should align to any provided by CMS in support of Medicaid and Exchange business operations and requirements. States should work to streamline and standardize these operational approaches and business workflows to minimize customization demands on technology solutions and optimize business outcomes.\nThere are those business processes that all States perform (e.g., Enroll Provider) and those that are voluntary and depend on implementation of special programs within a state (e.g., pay Managed Care Organization capitation or enrollment of member in a special program). The BPM defines common business practices across all State Medicaid Enterprises. The MITA Framework BPM offers a hierarchy of Tier 1 business areas, Tier 2 business categories and Tier 3 business processes. The MITA Framework contains ten (10) business areas divided into twenty-one (21) business categories with eighty (80) individual business processes. See Part I, Appendix C, Business Process Model Details.\nThe BPM provides a Business Process Template (BPT) for describing each business process. The BPT provides a summary of the business process, trigger event and result, activity steps, data requirements, predecessor and successor processes, failure points, and other elements. The NMEH workgroups review business processes, and they stand to benefit from ongoing review by state workgroups.

    "text": "Introduction to Business Capability Models\nA capability model is a conceptual framework that outlines the key capabilities an organization needs to achieve its strategic objectives. It provides a comprehensive view of what an organization can do and helps identify areas for improvement or investment. In the context of an orchestra, a capability model might help the orchestra identify the set of skills and resources, or other types of capabilities it needs to perform a symphony. Just like an orchestra needs well practiced musicians, sheet music, instruments, a conductor, and an audience to produce a great symphony, a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) needs its Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) to employ or develop specific capabilities to deliver its services effectively, efficiently, and economically to its enrollees and providers.\nThe concept of a business capability is extensively used within enterprise architecture modeling and has been broadly used within Business Capability Models as a tool to better align the business strategy and information technology of both private sector and governmental organizations since they emerged in the mid-2000s. One example comes from the TOGAF Standard, a well-known standard in enterprise architecture. Like most architecture frameworks TOGAF defines a capability as something a business can do to meet its goals. This focuses a strategic lens of an organization on “what” it needs to achieve its goals, rather than “how” those goals are achieved. This perspective allows for business planning from different viewpoints, facilitating strategic alignment and operational efficiency.\nSMA business architects, technologists, systems analysts, executives, managers, and program staff can use this same modeling approach to represent the functional components of their Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) in ways that can help reveal gaps in their systems and provide insights on what new or enhanced capabilities might be needed to close those gaps.\nBy focusing on capabilities, SMAs can better align their information and technology resources and processes with their strategic business goals, ultimately improving their insight into how to improve the outcomes their Medicaid Enterprise Architecture produces.",

The MITA Capability Model provides a structured way for SMAs to identify, conceptually model, and improve the capabilities needed for efficient Medicaid operations.\nIt is important to note that MITA 4.0 does not endeavor to specify all of the capabilities SMA’s may need to administer Medicaid programs; instead, this version of MITA focuses on the capabilities that are most closely oriented towards achieving the CMS-required outcomes. In this way MITA 4.0 provides a reference model for SMAs to model other capabilities that may be needed to achieve their other goals such as state specific outcomes, or other state priorities while providing more guidance within the MITA Framework to support modular.\n\n\nUpdate to MITA 3.0\nMITA 3.0 defined a capability as the level of maturity of a set of business processes within a business category. By focusing on “how” MES operate MITA 3.0 helped SMA’s identify ways to improve and mature their business processes, but it did not link those processes with the outcomes they are intended to achieve or ensure better alignment of the information and technical architectures to business outcomes. The addition of the MITA capability model to the MITA 4.0 business architecture addresses that by providing the conceptual linkages needed to elevate the strategic vantage point of the MITA Framework. To guide this change, we present within this chapter a definition, description, and approach to modeling business capabilities, based on the widely used capability models contextualized for Medicaid Enterprises.\nThe business processes that operationalize MITA capabilities remain foundational to characterizing the business architecture, and are by definition a constituent part of any MITA capability. They provide essential information on how capabilities are operationalize and should continue to be a routinely utilized reference model for SMA business process mapping.

    "section": "The MITA Definition of Capability",
    "text": "The MITA Definition of Capability\nWithin the context of MITA, a capability can be defined as the ability or capacity of a State Medicaid Agency to achieve a desired outcome in compliance with the Standards and Conditions within 42 CFR 433.112. A capability may currently exist in an operational state or be envisioned for future development. Through careful planning, capabilities defined in this way can be matured and refined over time to become more effective and efficient. They can be organized and detailed at various levels of abstraction, providing precise descriptions for operational purposes or more generalized views for strategic planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Definition\n\n\n\n…a capability is defined as the ability or capacity of a SMA to achieve a desired outcome…\n\n\nTo fully define a business capability, it is essential to understand how it is realized through the integration of people, processes, information, and technology resources of an SMA. While these elements of the capability can change regularly, the capability itself is should endure over longer planning horizons, supporting the long-term alignment of business and IT and the achievement of increasingly beneficial business outcomes.\n\nStructure of the MITA Capability Model\nAs depicted in the model below, the MITA Capability Model orients the people, process, technology, and information resources to define a MITA Capability. This means that to model a capability the appropriate components of the information architecture and the technical architecture must be brought together with the business architecture to fully formulate any MITA Capability.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability Relationship Diagram\n\n\n\nBusiness Roles\nBusiness roles represent individual actors, stakeholders, or partners involved in delivering a business capability. A single organizational group or team may be wholly responsible for delivering the capability, or multiple business entities may share the delivery of a particular business capability. Business Roles perform Business Processes using Technology Resources. They require skills and knowledge resources to achieve outcomes, and should be actively engaged as partners in the development or enhancement of any capability they help deliver.\n\n\nBusiness Processes\nIndividual business capabilities may be enabled or delivered through a range of business processes that detail the activities (the how) associated with delivering the capability. Identifying and analyzing the efficiency of the underlying processes helps to optimize the business capability’s effectiveness. Identifying the processes within a business capability provides a focus for maturing the capability in concert with the other capability components. Business Processes operationalize Business Capabilities.\n\n\nInformation/Data\nInformation/data represents the business data, knowledge, and insight consumed or produced by the business capability (as distinct from IT-related data entities). This may also include information that the capability exchanges with other capabilities to support the execution of value streams. Examples include information about customers and prospects, products and services, business policies and rules, sales reports, and performance metrics. Information/data inform the Business Capability, answering questions and supporting business rules.\n\n\nTechnology Resources\nBusiness capabilities rely on a range of tools, applications, systems, and services for successful execution. Technology Resources use Information/data to facilitate Business Processes. Such resources may include:\n\nModular software applications\nCloud or on-premise infrastructure\nMicroservices\nAnalytics\nCustomer portal\n\nIn this way we can clearly interrelate all of the MITA architecture models and their individual components which allows us to reveal gaps not only in the individual components of the architecture, but also understand their impact on the integration of the architecture components at the capability level.\n\n\n\nRelationship of MITA Capabilities to Outcomes\nIn the context of the Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA), outcomes are intrinsically linked to capabilities, as they represent the tangible results achieved through the effective integration and execution of various elements that constitute a capability. In this sense, outcomes and capabilities define each other.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability and Outcome Relationship Diagram\n\n\n\nOutcomes\nMITA defines outcomes broadly to encompass CMS-required outcomes, state-specific outcomes, and other outcomes not mandated as part of the Advance Planning Document (APD) process. The sole criterion for an outcome to meet this definition is that it must be a goal of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) and be achieved through a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) capability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Definition\n\n\n\nA MITA outcome is a goal of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) that is achieved by a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) capability.\n\n\n\n\nMeasure\nMeasure is a quantifiable metric used to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of capabilities within a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES). Measures provide quantifiable and qualitative values that help State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs) track progress toward achieving specific outcomes, such as CMS-required or state-specific goals. These indicators might include metrics like processing times, error rates, or compliance levels.\nMeasures are a measurement threshold by establishing a specific value or level that must be met or exceeded to demonstrate successful performance. For instance, a KPI might set a threshold for the maximum allowable processing time for claims, ensuring that they are handled within a specified timeframe to maintain compliance and eligibility for enhanced federal funding. By monitoring these thresholds, organizations can ensure they are meeting regulatory requirements and delivering high-quality services to beneficiaries, while also identifying areas for improvement.\n\n\nMeasure Threshold\nA specific value or level of a measure that must be met or exceeded to demonstrate the effective achievement of a capability’s intended outcome. This threshold serves as a benchmark for assessing whether the processes, roles, and resources integrated within a Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) are functioning optimally to meet the goals of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA). For example, a measurement threshold might be set for processing times, where claims must be processed within a certain number of days to ensure compliance with CMS-required outcomes and maintain eligibility for enhanced federal funding. By establishing and monitoring these thresholds, organizations can ensure they are meeting regulatory requirements and delivering high-quality services to beneficiaries.\n\n\nMeasurement\nThese outcomes and metrics are also used to ensure that healthcare systems or modules comply with applicable federal regulations, forming the baseline for system or module functionality. Achieving these outcomes is essential for continuing to receive enhanced federal funding for operations. Regular measurement and analysis of KPIs help organizations demonstrate compliance and effectiveness, ensuring that they meet regulatory requirements and continue to deliver high-quality services to beneficiaries.\nIn this way we can clearly interrelate all of the MITA architecture models and their individual components with the KPIs, thresholds, and measurements that indicate whether our capability achieves our desired outcome.\nWhile models that help conceptualize the capabilities that achieve CMS-required outcomes are the ones modeled for this version of MITA, SMAs are encouraged to use these models as a reference to model capabilities.",

    "section": "Capability Mapping",
    "text": "Capability Mapping\nCapability mapping is a strategic tool that enables organizations, such as State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs), to systematically identify, organize, and visualize the key capabilities necessary to achieve their objectives. Within the MITA framework, capability mapping provides SMAs with a method of developing comprehensive views of the functions and processes required to deliver Medicaid services effectively. To begin the capability mapping process, SMAs should first identify the core capabilities that align with their strategic objectives, focusing on what the organization needs to achieve rather than how those goals are accomplished. This involves listing all necessary capabilities and understanding the desired outcomes they support. Next, these capabilities should be organized into domains and areas that reflect their strategic importance and interrelationships. Visualizing these capabilities through diagrams or maps provides all stakeholders a common view to understand the roles, processes, technology resources, and information/data involved in executing each capability, as well as the outcome each capability is designed to achieve. This structured approach not only highlights areas for improvement or investment but also ensures that organizational efforts are strategically aligned with desired outcomes.\nThe benefits of capability mapping are multifaceted, offering SMAs a clear pathway to strategic alignment and gap analysis. By visualizing capabilities, organizations can identify operational gaps and determine what new or enhanced capabilities are needed to close those gaps. This visualization also improves communication among stakeholders by providing a clear and concise representation of the organization’s functions. To refine capabilities, SMAs should analyze current operations, assess the efficiency of underlying processes, and optimize them to enhance capability effectiveness. Additionally, capability mapping serves as a foundation for heat mapping, which assesses the MITA Framework will utilize to visualize the maturity of each capability evaluated in the State Self-Assessment. SMAs can overlay heat maps over their capability maps to visualize many things other than maturity levels, using color coding to indicate areas of strength and weakness. Regular updates to these maps allow SMAs to monitor progress and ensure resources are allocated effectively to achieve strategic goals. The MITA framework includes examples of capability maps based on CMS-required outcomes, serving as a reference model for SMAs to develop their own capability maps tailored to state-specific goals and priorities. By leveraging the reference models provided by MITA, SMAs can ensure their capability mapping efforts are aligned with both federal requirements and state-specific priorities.\n\nOrganizing Capabilities\nTo enhance the resolution and detail of a capability and provide a unified view of all its components, a block diagram can be employed to provide a common view of any MES. This diagram effectively links the capability to business processes, roles, technical resources, and information resources through functional decomposition. By breaking down the capability into its constituent parts, the block diagram offers a visual representation that highlights the interrelationships and dependencies among these elements. This approach provides a clearer understanding of how each component contributes to the overall capability, facilitating more effective analysis, optimization, and alignment with organizational objectives.\n\nWe use this same method to present an this top level view of the capabilities required to achieve CMS-required outcomes. From this view increasingly detailed models can be constructed.\n\n\n\nMITA Capability Models\nThe MITA framework represents capabilities visually through a layered model that represent a capability of being composed of sub-capabilities and the processes, roles, information and technology resources (PRIT) that support the business in sustaining the capability. Each layer up depicts increasingly strategic capabilities and each layer down depicts the constituent elements that compose a capability in increasing operational detail. It is not the intention of this version of MITA to provide a full operational or tactical view of a capability, though SMAs may consider using this approach to improve their organizational awareness of their operations by developing further layers of their capabilities through functional decomposition.\n\n\nCapability Domains: The first layer of this model aims to group capabilities to organize the strategic view of an SMA’s capabilities. In this view one or many capabilities can be grouped within a domain to indicate the pursuit of common outcomes. Each domain is denoted with a single number to help annotate each capability.\nCapability Areas: The second layer of this model aims to provide a view of the groups of capabilities that compose a domain. They are organized to show capabilities that serve a specific group of similar outcomes and essential\nCapabilities: The third layer of this model provides a more detailed view view of\n\n\n\n\nRelationship of MITA Capabilities to Maturity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUnder development.\n\n\n\nLevels of Maturity\n\nDescription of the five levels of maturity in the MITA framework\nHow capabilities evolve and mature over time\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Capability Maps for Heat Mapping Strategic Priorities and Identifying Gaps with the MITA Maturity Model\nCapability maps are powerful tools that not only provide a visual representation of an SMA’s key capabilities but also serve as a foundation for strategic analysis and planning. There are many approaches to heat mapping capabilities, each offering unique insights into organizational priorities and gaps. Here, we describe two approaches: assessing maturity levels using the MITA Maturity Model and prioritizing strategic outcomes.\n\nIdentifying Gaps with the MITA Maturity Model\nThe MITA Maturity Model provides a framework for assessing the maturity of an organization’s capabilities across various dimensions, such as business processes, information, and technology. By integrating the maturity model with capability maps, SMAs can identify gaps between their current state and desired maturity levels.\n\nExample 1: Identifying Gaps in Data Management Maturity Using the PRIT Model\nAn SMA is conducting an assessment of its data management capabilities using the MITA Maturity Model, with a focus on the PRIT (Processes, Roles, Information, and Technology) framework. The capability map includes various data-related capabilities, such as “Data Integration,” “Data Quality Management,” and “Data Analytics.” Each of these capabilities is evaluated across the PRIT dimensions to determine their maturity levels using the revised scale:\nProcesses: Level 1: Ad-Hoc Roles: Level 2: Compliant Information: Level 2: Compliant Technology: Level 2: Compliant The capability map is updated to reflect the maturity assessment, with each dimension marked with a color code: red for Level 1: Ad-Hoc, yellow for Level 2: Compliant, green for Level 3: Efficient, blue for Level 4: Optimized, and purple for Level 5: Pioneering. This visualization helps the SMA prioritize strategic actions to enhance the “Data Integration” capability, such as standardizing processes, refining roles, improving data quality, and upgrading technology.\n\n\n\nHeat Mapping Strategic Priorities\nHeat mapping involves applying a color-coded overlay to a capability map to visually represent the status or priority level of each capability. This technique can be used to highlight areas of strength, weakness, or strategic importance. For example, capabilities that are critical to achieving CMS-required outcomes might be marked in one color, while those needing immediate attention or improvement could be marked in another. This visual representation helps stakeholders quickly grasp the strategic landscape and make informed decisions about where to allocate resources and focus efforts.\n\nExample 2: Prioritizing Capabilities for CMS-Required Outcomes\nAn SMA is focused on achieving specific CMS-required outcomes related to improving patient care and reducing administrative costs. The agency creates a capability map that outlines all the capabilities necessary to meet these outcomes. By applying a heat map, the SMA highlights capabilities that are directly linked to these outcomes in green, indicating they are of high strategic priority. Capabilities that are indirectly related or less critical are marked in yellow, while those that are currently underperforming or not aligned with strategic goals are marked in red.\nThis visual representation allows the SMA to quickly identify which capabilities require immediate attention and resources to ensure compliance with CMS requirements. For instance, if the capability related to “Claims Processing Efficiency” is marked in red, the agency can prioritize initiatives to enhance this capability, such as investing in new technology or streamlining processes.\n\n\n\nOther Uses for Capability Heat Mapping\nBeyond assessing maturity levels and prioritizing strategic initiatives, capability heat mapping can be applied in various other contexts to enhance organizational effectiveness and alignment.\n\nExample 3: Aligning Capabilities with State-Specific Initiatives\nAn SMA is working on a state-specific initiative to enhance telehealth services for rural populations. The capability map includes capabilities related to telehealth, such as “Telehealth Infrastructure,” “Provider Engagement,” and “Patient Access.” The SMA uses a heat map to highlight these capabilities in blue, indicating their alignment with the state-specific initiative.\nBy analyzing the capability map, the SMA identifies that “Provider Engagement” is a critical capability that requires further development to support the telehealth initiative. The agency decides to invest in training programs and outreach efforts to engage providers in rural areas, ensuring that the telehealth services are effectively delivered to the target population.\nThese examples demonstrate how capability maps, combined with heat mapping and the MITA Maturity Model, can provide valuable insights for strategic planning and gap analysis. By visualizing priorities and maturity levels, SMAs can make informed decisions about where to focus resources and efforts, ultimately enhancing their Medicaid Enterprise Systems and achieving strategic objectives.\n\nCapability Mapping\n\nIntroduction to capability mapping and its significance\nHow capabilities are organized and detailed at various levels of abstraction",

(See Front Matter, Chapter 6, Overview of the MITA Initiative, for a discussion of the Medicaid Enterprise.)\n\nEnterprise can have other meanings. For instance, Enterprise Architecture (EA) defines an enterprise-wide integrated set of components that incorporates strategic business thinking, information assets, and the technical infrastructure of an enterprise to promote information sharing across agency and organizational boundaries.\nThe BA acknowledges technology as one of several enablers that are important to growth and transformation, but it does not introduce technical implementations or solutions into the BA components. All technical references are found in Part III, Technical Architecture.\n\n\nBackground\nStates, territories, and the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as States) are responsible for their individual State Medicaid Enterprise, and all entities are different in important ways. Differences include:\n\nOrganizational structure, covered programs, and lines of business\nBusiness rules, policies, and procedures affecting stakeholders\nRelationships with other state and local agencies\nRevenue sources\nLocation of business units\nWorkflow\nRange of outsourcing\nTechnical solutions\n\n\nThese entities also differ in their concept of an enterprise, the roles and responsibilities of one or more Chief Information Officers (CIO), adoption of data and technical standards, and the use of legacy versus state-of-the-art applications.\nGiven these differences, it is not possible or desirable, in the context of the MITA Framework, to develop a standalone business and technical model for each individual Medicaid Enterprise. Instead, MITA establishes a national framework of common processes and enabling technologies to support improved program administration in all States.\nThe BA focuses on areas of common ground (e.g., that all States will enroll providers and pay for services rendered to eligible beneficiaries and that all States seek to improve health care outcomes and improve administrative processes).\nThere is no ready-made methodology for building the MITA Framework to accommodate the business needs and transformation strategies of the States. To meet the special needs of MITA, the components included in the BA draw upon methodologies commonly in use today across industries as diverse as financial, transportation, and defense. The MITA team designed templates and models to help States identify and prioritize their specific business needs.\nThe BA section of the MITA Framework shows how MITA incorporates business-driven design to accomplish the following:\n\nSupport state needs.\n\no Align with state strategic goals.\no Align with state or Medicaid Agency enterprise architecture.\n\nSupport the CMS and common state goals.\n\no Align state approaches with MITA.\no Accommodate multi-state collaborative initiatives.\n\nSupport national goals through alignment with national initiatives, such as the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and federal guidelines (e.g., Federal Health Architecture (FHA), the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF), and national/international data standards).",

    "section": "Purpose",
    "text": "Purpose\nIn keeping with the guiding principle that MITA represents a business-driven enterprise transformation, the BA is the starting point of the MITA Framework. The BA describes the needs and goals of the individual State Medicaid Enterprise, and presents a collective vision of the future.\nThe BA will accomplish the following:\n\nEstablish a generic business framework for all States while recognizing their differences.\nDescribe how each state Medicaid Program can mature over a given period with the help of stakeholders, leadership, enabling legislation, and technology.\nProvide a baseline for the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) to assess their current business capabilities and measure progress toward improved capabilities.\n\n\n\nScope\nThe BA focuses on the State Medicaid Enterprise that centers on the Medicaid environment including leveraged systems and interconnections among Medicaid stakeholders, providers, beneficiaries, insurance affordability programs (e.g., CHIP, tax credits, Basic Health Program), Health Insurance Exchange (HIX), Health Information Exchange (HIE), other state and local agencies, other payers, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and other federal agencies. The MITA context defines the Medicaid Enterprise as:\n\nThe domain where federal matching funds apply.\nThe interfaces and bridges among Medicaid stakeholders, including providers, beneficiaries, other state and local agencies, other payers, CMS, and other federal agencies.\nThe sphere of influence touched by MITA (e.g., national and federal initiatives such as the Nationwide Health Information Network [NwHIN]). (See Front Matter, Chapter 6, Overview of the MITA Initiative, for a discussion of the Medicaid Enterprise.)\n\nEnterprise can have other meanings. For instance, Enterprise Architecture (EA) defines an enterprise-wide integrated set of components that incorporates strategic business thinking, information assets, and the technical infrastructure of an enterprise to promote information sharing across agency and organizational boundaries.\nThe BA acknowledges technology as one of several enablers that are important to growth and transformation, but it does not introduce technical implementations or solutions into the BA components. All technical references are found in Part III, Technical Architecture.\n\n\nBackground\nStates, territories, and the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as States) are responsible for their individual State Medicaid Enterprise, and all entities are different in important ways. Differences include:\n\nOrganizational structure, covered programs, and lines of business\nBusiness rules, policies, and procedures affecting stakeholders\nRelationships with other state and local agencies\nRevenue sources\nLocation of business units\nWorkflow\nRange of outsourcing\nTechnical solutions\n\n\nThese entities also differ in their concept of an enterprise, the roles and responsibilities of one or more Chief Information Officers (CIO), adoption of data and technical standards, and the use of legacy versus state-of-the-art applications.\nGiven these differences, it is not possible or desirable, in the context of the MITA Framework, to develop a standalone business and technical model for each individual Medicaid Enterprise. Instead, MITA establishes a national framework of common processes and enabling technologies to support improved program administration in all States.\nThe BA focuses on areas of common ground (e.g., that all States will enroll providers and pay for services rendered to eligible beneficiaries and that all States seek to improve health care outcomes and improve administrative processes).\nThere is no ready-made methodology for building the MITA Framework to accommodate the business needs and transformation strategies of the States. To meet the special needs of MITA, the components included in the BA draw upon methodologies commonly in use today across industries as diverse as financial, transportation, and defense. The MITA team designed templates and models to help States identify and prioritize their specific business needs.\nThe BA section of the MITA Framework shows how MITA incorporates business-driven design to accomplish the following:\n\nSupport state needs.\n\no Align with state strategic goals.\no Align with state or Medicaid Agency enterprise architecture.\n\nSupport the CMS and common state goals.\n\no Align state approaches with MITA.\no Accommodate multi-state collaborative initiatives.\n\nSupport national goals through alignment with national initiatives, such as the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and federal guidelines (e.g., Federal Health Architecture (FHA), the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF), and national/international data standards).",

The Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) is a mechanized claims processing and information retrieval system used by the States for Title XIX of the Social Security Act (The Act); therefore, the guidance set forth in CMS 42 CFR Part 433 applies to the MMIS as well as the Medicaid eligibility determination and enrollment activities as set forth in the Affordable Care Act of 2010.\nCMS expects States to meet the standards and conditions specified in §433.112(b)(10) through §433.112(b)(16). The standards and conditions are descriptive in nature; however, CMS recognizes that in order for the States to meet these standards and conditions it is necessary to provide additional guidance that clearly articulates its criteria for meeting them\n\nin terms of timeliness, accuracy, efficiency, integrity, and performance standards for mechanized claims processing. In response to this need, additional guidance materials include:\n\nEnhanced Funding Requirements: Seven Conditions and Standards (a.k.a.

These outcomes are outside of the Outcomes-based Planning (OBP) process. This document will focus on State-specific outcomes. State-specific outcomes are developed by states and should be measurable, achievable, and reflect the short-term goals of the MES project. Metrics provide measurable evidence that the outcomes are achieved on an ongoing basis. States are required to report on the system’s performance to CMS as a condition for receiving enhanced funding.\nDocument what outcomes are, why you should use the OBP process to develop your state-specific outcomes, how outcomes connect to the MITA 4.0 State Self-Assessment (SSA), triggers and objectives for OBP, and the OBP process.\nPurpose of the Outcomes-based Planning Process 1. Consistent and repeatable process: A structured process ensures that outcomes are identified consistently across the organization, making it easier to replicate, scale and identify trends. 2. Sustainable: A well-designed process is sustainable and can be applied regardless of the team or individuals involved, reducing reliance on specific people. 3. Transparency: A clear process provides transparency into the outcome identification process, making it easier to communicate and get consensus and alignment with stakeholders and build trust. 4. Traceability: A structured process ensures that outcomes are traceable to the original challenge or opportunity, helping to maintain focus and context. 5. Continuous Improvement: Given that the process improves transparency, it helps to ensure that outcomes are regularly reviewed and refined, driving ongoing improvement. Other benefits include: 1. Efficient resource allocation: A well-designed process helps to allocate resources to initiatives that drive meaningful change and align with strategic goals. 2. Improved accountability: A clear process promotes accountability among team members, as everyone understands what needs to be achieved. 3. Enhanced collaboration: A structured process facilitates collaboration among stakeholders, ensuring that everyone is working towards common goals.",

    "text": "Outcomes can take many forms and represent different things to different audiences. When used for planning, some forms of outcomes are more useful than others. The form of outcomes associated with OBP includes certain characteristics and qualities described here, which guide decisions and activities throughout the planning process. For OBP, an outcome is a well-defined, observable, and measurable change in the existing situation that focuses on the end impact of those affected. It expresses changes as benefits, by improving capabilities within an organization or for its stakeholders. An ideal outcome should have the following characteristics – 1. Change – What are we changing? 2. Affected Stakeholders – Who and what will it impact? 3. Benefits – What are the benefits of the change? 4. Capability – What new or improved capabilities are required to make this change happen? Capabilities could be related to systems, manual processes, staff capabilities. etc.\nExample: Improve provider satisfaction ratings by 15% within the next six months. Characteristics of the above Outcome statement: Change: Improve satisfaction with the Provider Enrollment approval timeline by providing additional interactive channels to resolve issues. (What is the goal?) Affected Stakeholders: Providers, Provider Organization, State users, etc. (Whose need is it addressing?) Benefits: Leads to quicker onboarding of providers, provider retention, and decreases state staff workload. (Why is it important?) Capability: Might require an enhancement to redefine the Provider Enrollment process such as incorporating real-time updates to the workflow and adding interactive channels to provide real-time issue resolution. (How do you achieve it?)",

Improve Program Performance Through Strategic Alignment\nOBP aligns system investments with Medicaid program priorities and operational needs.\nExample:\nAchieving real-time eligibility verification in 90% of cases.\n\n\n3. Strengthen Organizational Readiness and Capability\nOBP ensures system improvements are accompanied by organizational conditions needed for success, such as change management and workforce development.\nExample:\nDecreasing average eligibility determination time by 25% within six months.\n\n\n4. Create a Culture of Measurement and Accountability\nOBP encourages a results-oriented management culture, where success is measured by tangible impact on Medicaid program performance and beneficiary outcomes.\n\n\n5. Enable Consistency and Reusability Across State Projects\nOBP supports a structured, repeatable approach to articulating goals and expected impact, promoting consistency across projects and enabling reusability.",
