Don’t start with technology solutions.\n\n\n2. Engage Stakeholders Early\nInclude business, technical, and program stakeholders from the beginning. MITA 4.0 works best as a collaborative framework.\n\n\n3. Use the Reference Models\nLeverage the capability, business, information, and technical reference models to: - Identify common patterns - Avoid reinventing solutions - Ensure alignment with industry standards\n\n\n4. Conduct Regular Self-Assessments\nUse the State Self-Assessment process to: - Track maturity progress - Identify gaps and opportunities - Prioritize improvement initiatives\n\n\n5. Leverage Available Tools\nTake advantage of MITA 4.0 tools and resources: - ORBIT for planning and tracking - State Self-Assessment Tool for maturity evaluation - Templates for documentation - Quick reference guides for implementation\n\n\n6. Align with CMS Guidance\nEnsure your MITA implementation supports CMS requirements for: - APD submissions - Certification and compliance - Federal reporting\n\n\n7. Think Modular and Incremental\nAdopt a modular approach: - Break large initiatives into manageable pieces - Deliver value incrementally - Learn and adjust as you go\n\n\n8. Share and Learn\nEngage with the MITA community: - Share experiences with other states - Learn from implementations across the nation - Participate in MITA forums and events\n\n\nGetting Started\nReady to begin? Follow these steps:\n\nReview the Understanding MITA 4.0 section\nExplore the Implementing MITA 4.0 guide\nAccess the Tools and Resources available to support your work\nContact CMS for additional guidance and support\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors\nOrganizations that successfully adopt MITA 4.0 typically: - Have executive sponsorship - Dedicate resources to the effort - Engage stakeholders broadly - Take an iterative approach - Measure and communicate progress - Seek guidance when needed\nFor questions about adoption or implementation, please visit the Contact Us section.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "What is a Capability?\nA capability is a particular ability that an organization needs to achieve a specific outcome. Capabilities describe what needs to be done, not how it’s done. This distinction is crucial because:\n\nThe what (capability) tends to remain stable over time\nThe how (technology, processes, organization) changes as technology evolves\n\n\n\nExamples of Capabilities\n\nMember Management: The ability to maintain accurate, current information about Medicaid beneficiaries\nClaims Processing: The ability to adjudicate and pay provider claims accurately and timely\nProvider Enrollment: The ability to enroll, credential, and maintain provider information\nEligibility Determination: The ability to determine if an applicant qualifies for Medicaid benefits\n\n\n\nThe MITA Capability Model\nThe MITA 4.0 Capability Reference Model organizes capabilities into a hierarchical structure:\n\nLevel 1: Capability Areas\nHigh-level groupings of related capabilities (e.g., Member Services, Provider Services, Operations)\n\n\nLevel 2: Capability Domains\nLogical groupings within areas (e.g., within Member Services: Eligibility, Enrollment, Benefits)\n\n\nLevel 3: Capabilities\nSpecific abilities needed to achieve outcomes\n\n\nLevel 4: Sub-Capabilities\nDetailed components of capabilities when needed for clarity\n\n\n\nWhy Capabilities Matter\n\n1. Outcome Achievement\nCapabilities are the bridge between strategic outcomes and implementation. They help you identify what your organization needs to be able to do to achieve desired outcomes.\n\n\n2. Common Language\nCapabilities provide a common vocabulary for business and IT stakeholders to discuss needs and solutions.\n\n\n3. Reusability\nBy focusing on capabilities rather than systems, you can identify opportunities to reuse existing capabilities across multiple initiatives.\n\n\n4. Modular Design\nCapability-based planning supports modular system design, making implementations more flexible and maintainable.\n\n\n5. Gap Analysis\nComparing required capabilities to existing capabilities reveals gaps that need to be addressed.\n\n\n\nCapability Characteristics\nEffective capability definitions are:\n\nBusiness-Focused: Described in business terms, not technical jargon\nStable: Remain relevant despite technology changes\nMeasurable: Can assess maturity and performance\nOutcome-Linked: Connected to specific business outcomes\nTechnology-Agnostic: Don’t prescribe specific solutions\n\n\n\nCapability Attributes\nEach capability in the MITA Reference Model includes:\n\nName: Clear, concise identifier\nDescription: What the capability enables\nOutcomes: Which outcomes the capability supports\nBusiness Functions: Related business processes\nInformation: Key data elements\nTechnology: Relevant technical patterns\nMaturity Levels: Progression from basic to advanced\n\n\n\nUsing Capabilities in Planning\n\nStep 1: Identify Required Capabilities\nBased on your defined outcomes and objectives, identify which capabilities you need. Use the Capability Reference Model as a guide.\n\n\nStep 2: Assess Current State\nEvaluate your organization’s current capability maturity using the State Self-Assessment process.\n\n\nStep 3: Define Target State\nDetermine the desired maturity level for each capability based on your outcomes and objectives.\n\n\nStep 4: Identify Gaps\nCompare current state to target state to identify capability gaps.\n\n\nStep 5: Prioritize\nPrioritize which capabilities to develop or enhance based on: - Impact on outcomes - Dependencies between capabilities - Available resources - Risk\n\n\nStep 6: Plan Implementation\nDevelop a roadmap for building or enhancing capabilities, including: - Business process changes - Organizational/role changes - Information/data requirements - Technology solutions\n\n\n\nCapability vs. System\nA key distinction in MITA 4.0:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapability\nSystem\n\n\n\n\nWhat you need to do\nHow you do it\n\n\nBusiness-focused\nTechnology-focused\n\n\nStable over time\nChanges with technology\n\n\nMultiple systems can support one capability\nOne system may support multiple capabilities\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Member Portal Capability\nCapability: Member Self-Service - What: Enable beneficiaries to access their information and perform transactions independently\nImplementation Options: - Web application - Mobile app - Interactive voice response (IVR) - Kiosk\nThe capability (self-service) remains constant, but the implementation (technology) can vary or evolve.\n\n\nCapability Relationships\nCapabilities don’t exist in isolation. Understanding relationships helps with planning:\n\nDependencies: Some capabilities require others (e.g., Claims Payment depends on Claims Adjudication)\nComposition: Larger capabilities composed of smaller ones\nShared Data: Capabilities that use common information\nProcess Flow: Capabilities that work together in business processes\n\n\n\nTools and Resources\n\nCapability Reference Model: Complete catalog of MITA capabilities\nORBIT Tool: Map outcomes to required capabilities\nCapability Assessment Worksheets: Evaluate capability maturity\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nReview the Capability Reference Model for detailed capability definitions\nLearn about Business Functions, Roles, Information, and Technology that implement capabilities\nSee Implementing MITA 4.0 for step-by-step guidance on identifying required capabilities\nConduct a State Self-Assessment to evaluate your current capability maturity\n\nFor questions about capabilities, visit the FAQs or Contact Us.",

This is the first step in identifying the “to-be” state. An example would be, “Organizations are able to share information electronically.”\nIdentify the audience that would benefit from the outcome and the desired result from their perspective.\nIdentify what new or improved capability is needed to correct the concerns or facilitate the drivers, and the actor to implement the capability.\nSummarize the capability and benefits in an Outcome Statement.\n\nDetermine how to measure achievement or success. Determine how to measure, monitor, and report on progress to ensure improvements or benefits are reached.\n\nIdentify the success factors that provide the strongest indication of success and why.\nFor each success factor, corrected driver, and benefit, identify how to measure their status and improvement (either a metric or milestone).\n\nDefine what success looks like and how it can be validated.\n\nDetermine the desired time frame for accomplishing a goal.\nBased on the metrics associated with the critical success factors, identify target measurements that will indicate success.\nSummarize the time frame and metrics into a definition of success.
